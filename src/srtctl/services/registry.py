"""Service kinds: what ``services[].type`` selects.

A kind supplies defaults (command, start phase, criticality) and the environment
a service of that kind needs at launch. It never launches anything itself; the
``ServiceStageMixin`` does that uniformly for every kind. Register a new kind
with :func:`register_service`, the same pattern as ``@register_benchmark``.

# DeepSeek-V4-Pro (1.6T MoE, MXFP4) — 1k/1k on GB300

This directory contains NVIDIA-verified SGLang recipes for **DeepSeek-V4-Pro**
(1.6T-parameter MoE with MXFP4 MoE weights + FP8 KV, UE8M0 scales) on **GB300**
(ARM64 Grace + Blackwell, 4 GPU per node), 1024 input / 1024 output workload.
Both **aggregated** (single-node SGLang) and **disaggregated** (1P+1D dynamo +
NIXL) serving modes are covered.

## Container

All recipes reference the `dsv4-grace-blackwell` alias defined in
`srtslurm.yaml.example`. Pull + convert:

```bash
enroot import --output sglang-deepseek-v4-grace-blackwell.sqsh \
  docker://lmsysorg/sglang:deepseek-v4-grace-blackwell
```

(Use the `deepseek-v4-blackwell` image for B200 x86_64, or `deepseek-v4-hopper` for H200.)

## Model checkpoint

```bash
hf download deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V4-Pro --local-dir /shared/models/deepseek/DeepSeek-V4-Pro
```

### Aggregated (single SGLang server)

| file | parallelism | MTP | target | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `agg-low-latency.yaml`  | TP=4                        | EAGLE 3/4 | minimum TPOT / best per-user latency | GB300 1 node |
| `agg-nomtp.yaml`        | TP=4                        | —         | baseline throughput, no spec decoding | GB300 1 node |
| `agg-balanced-tep.yaml` | TP=4 + DP=4 + DP-attn + DeepEP | EAGLE 1/2 | Pareto mid-curve                     | GB300 1 node |
| `agg-max-tpt-tep.yaml`  | TP=4 + DP=4 + DP-attn + DeepEP | —         | maximum TPS/GPU                      | GB300 1 node |
| `agg-2n-low-latency.yaml` | TP=8                      | EAGLE 3/4 | low-latency, 2× memory headroom     | GB300 2 nodes |
| `agg-2n-nomtp.yaml`     | TP=8                        | —         | throughput, 2× memory headroom       | GB300 2 nodes |

### Disaggregated (dynamo frontend, NIXL KV transfer)

> ⚠️ **Required SGLang patch (upstreaming in flight).** All disagg
> recipes below depend on a fix to `python/sglang/srt/disaggregation/nixl/conn.py`
> that registers and transfers the model's auxiliary state buffers
> (SWA / NSA / Mamba) alongside the KV cache. Without this patch the NIXL
> backend silently drops the state buffer, causing decode-side accuracy
> to collapse on DSv4-Pro (GSM8K ≈ 0.13 vs 1.00 with the patch) even
> though throughput numbers look healthy. The fix mirrors what the
> Mooncake backend already does; an upstream sglang PR is being prepared
> separately. Until it lands, point your `dsv4-grace-blackwell` container
> at a build with the patch applied (mounting the patched
> `python/sglang/srt/disaggregation/nixl/` over the container path is
> sufficient). The recipes themselves intentionally do **not** declare
> any local mounts — pick up the patch via your container build process.
>
> Performance numbers in the table further down were measured against a
> patched build; they should reproduce on any build that includes the
> equivalent fix.

`XPYD` in the table below denotes **X prefill nodes + Y decode nodes**
(one SGLang worker per role per node, NOT per-instance counts). Each
GB300 node has 4 GPUs, so e.g. 2P2D DEP=8 = 16 GPUs total.

| file | topology | parallelism | MoE backend | target | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `disagg-1p1d-tp4-mxfp4.yaml`            | 1P+1D (2 nodes / 8 GPU)  | both TP=4                       | flashinfer_mxfp4 | low-latency, low/medium concurrency       | TP-only baseline |
| `disagg-1p1d-dep4-mega-moe.yaml`        | 1P+1D (2 nodes / 8 GPU)  | both TP=4 + DP=4 + DeepEP       | mega_moe (DeepGEMM) | DEP throughput Pareto reference        | TEP topology, mirrors `agg-max-tpt-tep.yaml` split across 2 nodes |
| `disagg-1p2d-dep4-to-dep8-mega-moe.yaml`| 1P+2D (3 nodes / 12 GPU) | P: TP=4+DP=4; D: TP=8+DP=8 + DeepEP | mega_moe (DeepGEMM) | **best per-GPU efficiency** for decode-heavy 1k/1k | asymmetric — decode EP domain doubled |
| `disagg-2p2d-dep8-mega-moe.yaml`        | 2P+2D (4 nodes / 16 GPU) | both TP=8 + DP=8 + DeepEP       | mega_moe (DeepGEMM) | largest DEP throughput config             | symmetric counterpart to the 1P2D recipe |
| `disagg-2p2d-tp8-mxfp4.yaml`            | 2P+2D (4 nodes / 16 GPU) | both TP=8                       | flashinfer_mxfp4 | TP-only 4-node baseline                    | quantifies the DEP+DeepEP uplift on GB300 |

Multi-node decode recipes intentionally do NOT set
`SGLANG_OPT_USE_CUSTOM_ALL_REDUCE_V2`: CAR_V2 is single-node only and
silently corrupts results when used across nodes.

#### Verified throughput (sa-bench, isl=osl=1024, random_range_ratio=0.8)

Peak Total TPS / GPU at the saturation point of each curve (lower-conc
points trade throughput for latency; full Pareto curves available on
request):

| recipe | GPUs | peak conc | Output TPS | Total TPS / GPU | Mean TTFT | Mean TPOT |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `disagg-1p1d-tp4-mxfp4.yaml`             |  8 |  128 |  3,349 |   838 |  1.05 s | 36.1 ms |
| `disagg-1p1d-dep4-mega-moe.yaml`         |  8 |  128 |  3,293 |   824 |  0.88 s | 36.8 ms |
| `disagg-2p2d-tp8-mxfp4.yaml`             | 16 |  512 |  6,863 |   857 |  2.26 s | 70.2 ms |
| `disagg-2p2d-dep8-mega-moe.yaml`         | 16 | 2,048 | 32,840 | 4,104 |  2.12 s | 58.2 ms |
| `disagg-1p2d-dep4-to-dep8-mega-moe.yaml` | 12 | 2,048 | 33,442 | **5,572** |  4.26 s | 53.8 ms |

Headline: the asymmetric 1P2D DEP4→DEP8 config delivers the highest
**per-GPU** total throughput because at 1k/1k the workload is
decode-heavy, so doubling the decode EP domain (4 → 8 GPUs, 256 → 32
experts/GPU) buys far more than scaling prefill.

## Key flags (derived from the SGLang DSv4 cookbook)

- `moe-runner-backend: flashinfer_mxfp4` — MXFP4 MoE kernels (Blackwell only).
- `chunked-prefill-size: 4096` + `disable-flashinfer-autotune: true` — cookbook recipe.
- `disable-radix-cache: true` — synthetic benchmark best practice; also
  reduces contiguous-allocator fragmentation at weight-reorder time.
- `mem-fraction-static: 0.78` — leaves headroom for the MXFP4
  `reorder_w1w3_to_w3w1` path (0.82 intermittently OOMs on GB300).
- TEP recipes: `enable-dp-attention + moe-a2a-backend: deepep` plus
  `deepep-config num_sms=96` (DeepEP `DEEPEP_LARGE_SMS_FLAG` for single-node
  Blackwell per cookbook).
